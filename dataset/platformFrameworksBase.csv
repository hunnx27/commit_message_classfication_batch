"Correct mapping for `boot-after-ota` compilation reason          The `boot` compilation reason is now deprecated (since Android S),     but the mapping between PackageManagerService.REASON_BOOT_AFTER_OTA     and the corresponding value in ART_COMPILATION_FILTER has not been     updated (or it has been incorrect all along).

"Stop VPN profiles by exiting VpnRunner instead of prepareInternal          Change to call the VpnRunner.exit to stop vpn profile     instead of using prepareInternal to leave the package intact.     This aligns with the way that VpnServices are disconnected     so that the package and other related information will not be     reset unexpectedly.

"Fix ADB key file reading          The `adb_temp_keys.xml` file is used to keep track of each ADB key and     when it was previously connected. It also keeps track of authorized WiFi     networks. It is written correctly, however, the parser currently is     unable to read the file that it wrote, meaning that:     1. ADB keys never properly expire     2. WiFi APs are never properly restored          Furthermore, because of complex interactions with restoring the adb_keys     file in Test Harness Mode, duplicate keys get appended repteatedly to     the adb_keys file if they're not in the key map.          This cleans up the file, making it more testable, adds tests for the     previously broken functionality, and just performs some simple     restructuring of bits of the code that were error-prone.          Now, the adb_keys file is nothing but a view of the temp keys file. When     keys are added to the temp keys file, we completely rewrite the adb_keys     file with the set of keys present in the temp keys file, meaning that     duplicates cannot be added.          This also introduces a method for other system services (primarily for     TestHarnessModeService) to notify the AdbDebuggingManager that the key     files were modified, and it should reload the state.

"BaseBundle.java: Recycle underlying parcel when bundle is cleared.          Lazy Bundles, (aosp/1787847), introduced a change in behavior where a Parcel     created as part of initializing a Bundle is dependent on the next ART GC run to be     recycled, causing a short term memory-leak.          To land this in T, we are making the change targetted and allowing     consumers to opt into the parcel being immediately cleared by calling     .clear() on the bundle.          As part of the unparcel() in clear(), mParcelledData is set to null, and     mMap may or may not still contain references through lazy values,     depending on if the lazy valyes have been unmarshalled.  As     such, we keep a weak reference to mParcelledData we can use to recycle it.          The mParcelledData reference could have been copied to other bundles in     a few operations:     new Bundle(Bundle o)     bundle.deepCopy()     bundle.putAll()          In this case we can not recycle the parcel yet as other bundles may     still require it.

"UsageStatsService: ignore removed users in persistPendingEventsLocked()          If a pre-created user is removed before it becomes a full user, the     ACTION_USER_REMOVED intent is never sent, so UsageStatsService is never     notified that the user's pending events should be discarded.  It will     eventually try to persist the events.  As the first step, it tries to     create /data/system_de/$userId/usagestats and the parent directory     /data/system_de/$userId if it doesn't already exist.          However, due to https://r.android.com/2078213 the SELinux policy no     longer allows system_server to create /data/system_de/$userId.  The     failure to create this directory is causing UsageStatsService to throw     an IllegalStateException which crashes system_server.          (Before the sepolicy change, system_server could create     /data/system_de/$userId, so the crash wouldn't have happened.  But     problems still might have occurred if the user ID was reused.)          The underlying user state tracking bug still needs to be fixed.  For     now, just avoid crashing system_server unnecessarily, and avoid an     SELinux denial by using mkdir() instead of mkdirs().

"Consolidate point where ADB is enabled for Test Harness Mode          Test Harness Mode relies on enabling ADB upon boot. However, currently,     there appears to be a race condition when enabling ADB. Test Harness     Mode enables ADB in PHASE_BOOT_COMPLETED, and ADB sets itself up in     PHASE_ACTIVITY_MANAGER_READY, both by writing a setting. It appears that     sometimes, the setting for initializing ADB's state commits *after* the     setting to enable ADB for Test Harness Mode, which means that ADB turns     on for a brief moment, then off until the device is manually fixed.          This changes it so that the AdbService checks the Test Harness Mode     property when initializing ADB state, always enabling ADB on boot if     Test Harness Mode is enabled.

"Ignore errors preparing user storage for existing users          Unfortunately we can't rule out the existence of devices where the user     storage wasn't properly prepared, due to StorageManagerService     previously ignoring errors from mVold.prepareUserStorage, combined with     OEMs potentially creating files in per-user directories too early.  And     forcing these broken devices to be factory reset upon taking an OTA is     not currently considered to be acceptable.          One option is to only check for prepareUserStorage errors on devices     that launched with T or later.  However, this is a serious issue and it     would be strongly preferable to do more than that.          Therefore, this CL makes it so that errors are checked for all new     users, rather than all new devices.  A field ignorePrepareStorageErrors     is added to the user record; it is only ever set to true implicitly,     when reading a user record from disk that lacks this field.  This field     is used by StorageManagerService to decide whether to check for errors.          Bug: 164488924     Bug: 224585613     Test: Intentionally made a device affected by this issue by reverting     the CLs that introduced the error checks, and changing vold to     inject an error into prepareUserStorage.   Then, flashed a build     with this CL without wiping userdata.  The device still boots, as     expected, and the log shows that the error was intentionally     ignored.  Tested that if a second user is added, the error is     *not* ignored and the second user's storage is destroyed before it     can be used.  Finally, wiped the device and verified that it won't     boot up anymore, as expected since error checking is enabled for     the system user in that case.

"UserDataPreparer: reboot to recovery for system user only          With the next CL, old devices might contain a combination of old users     with prepareUserStorage error checking disabled and new users with     prepareUserStorage error checking enabled.  Factory resetting the whole     device when any user fails to prepare may be too aggressive.  Also,     UserDataPreparer already destroys the affected user's storage when it     fails to prepare, which seems to be fairly effective at breaking things     for that user (absent proper error handling by upper layers).          Therefore, let's only factory reset the device if the failing user is     the system user.

"UserDataPreparer: reboot to recovery if preparing user storage fails          StorageManager.prepareUserStorage() can throw an exception if a     directory cannot be encrypted, for example due to already being     nonempty.  In this case, usage of the directory must not be allowed to     proceed.  UserDataPreparer currently handles this by deleting the user's     directories, but the error is still ultimately suppressed and starting     the user is still allowed to proceed.          The correct behavior in this case is to reboot into recovery to ask the     user to factory reset the device.  This is already what happens when     'init' fails to encrypt a directory with the system DE policy.  However,     this was overlooked for the user directories.  Start doing this.

"UserDataPreparer: fix volume preparation order          Internal storage must be prepared before adoptable storage, since the     user's volume keys are stored in their internal storage.  Previously,     the order depended on the Java hashcodes of the volume IDs.  It seems     that in practice things sort of worked out anyway even with the wrong     order, via a bizarre sequence of events involving the user's storage     being deleted and re-created several times.  Regardless, let's fix it.          destroyUserData() sort of had the reverse bug, although I don't think it     actually mattered.  My concern there was that destroying the internal     storage first would bypass vold's destroyKey() for the volume keys.     However, that's okay since the volume keys don't actually need a special     destruction procedure in this case.  Also, internal storage has already     been locked when destroyUserData() runs anyway.

"UsageStatsService: don't create stuff directly in /data/system_de          /data/system_de is only for per-user data; it *must* only contain     per-user encrypted directories.  Only vold should ever create anything     directly in this directory.  In preparation for removing system_server's     write access to this directory (https://r.android.com/2078213), make     UsageStatsService store its globalcomponentusage file at     /data/system/usagestats/globalcomponentusage instead of     /data/system_de/usagestats/globalcomponentusage.          Migration happens lazily, except that the old file and directory aren't     ever deleted since the SELinux policy will no longer allow system_server     to do that; the old file just stops being used.  vold will need to     handle the cleanup instead, or we could just leave the file around.          Note that before Android 11, UsageStatsService stored per-user stats in     /data/system/usagestats/$userId.  These per-user stats are *not* the     same thing as globalcomponentusage, which was added in Android 12.     UsageStatsService contains code to migrate the per-user stats to     /data/system_ce/$userId/usagestats.  This is fine, and is the right     thing to do, since the per-user stats are potentially sensitive per-user     data.  This does mean that UsageStatsService now implements two types of     migrations, and that the source directory for one migration is the     target directory for the other, which is a bit unfortunate.  However,     since different files are involved in each one, it all works out.

"UserDataPreparer: only delete contents of user's system CE and DE dirs          The /data/system_ce/$userId and /data/system_de/$userId directories are     created by vold, so they should be deleted by vold as well, and in fact     that would already happen except that system_server deletes them     recursively before vold gets to it.  Change system_server to delete just     the contents of these directories.          This is a prerequisite to locking down the ability to create these     directories (https://r.android.com/2078213), which is needed to stop     subdirectories from accidentally being created too early.  Technically     we could achieve this goal without limiting delete access, as it's     create access that really matters, but having the operations be paired     properly is much cleaner.

"Treat failure to create a process group as fatal          During process startup, system creates a process group and places the     new process in it. If process group creation fails for some reason, the     new child process will stay in its parent's group. This poses danger     when the child is being frozen because the whole group is affected and     its parent is being frozen as well. Considering that the parent of an     app is Zygote, freezing it leads to the device becoming unusable.     Fix this by treating group creation failure as a fatal error which would     prevent the app from starting. When system_server fails to create a     process group, it will throw an exception that's not caught and will     self-destruct.

"Ignore older UID state change callbacks in NPMS.          Since the onUidStateChanged() callbacks will be     happening from more than one thread, we need to make     sure we only handle the latest uid state change     callbacks and ignore any older callbacks that could     override the latest uid states in NPMS.

"Disallow PAP authentication when MPPE is requested          MPPE cannot work if PAP is used as authentication, so it is not useful     to allow PAP authentication when MPPE is enforced: establishing the     tunnel would fail anyway with `MPPE required, but MS-CHAP[v2] auth not     performed`.     Also users enforcing MPPE may assume that this means PAP will not be     used for authentication, so without this change MPPE enforcement gives a     false sense of security, as PAP uses plain-text credentials.

"[DO NOT MERGE] Fixed status bar glitch for apps that access internal res          In 12L, to support mulit-display devices, we changed the way to get the     status bar height by adding an API to calculate instead of directly     reading the resource of status_bar_height.          However, some apps still using Resources.getIdentify() to get this     internal resources dimen as status bar height to layout their UI which     cause status bar glitch in their app.          For compatibility purpose:     1. Create a new dimen res status_bar_height_default which will be used     by framework to determine the status bar heigth     2.

"[DO NOT MERGE] Fixed status bar glitch for apps that access internal res          In 12L, to support mulit-display devices, we changed the way to get the     status bar height by adding an API to calculate instead of directly     reading the resource of status_bar_height.          However, some apps still using Resources.getIdentify() to get this     internal resources dimen as status bar height to layout their UI which     cause status bar glitch in their app.          For compatibility purpose:     1. Create a new dimen res status_bar_height_default which will be used     by framework to determine the status bar heigth     2.

"EntropyMixer: ensure new seed file is as good as old one          Generate the new seed by hashing the old seed together with some bytes     from /dev/urandom, rather than just using the bytes from /dev/urandom     alone.

"Clear mInterface before calling resetIkeState()          Clear mInterface before calling resetIkeState() in     onDefaultNetworkChanged().     resetIkeState() will trigger interfaceRemoved() to be called.

"RESTRICT AUTOMERGE: Polish IME transition from fullscreen task to split-screen task          As the new split-screen behavior that the root task of the split-screen     can be in the recents task, so using quick switch can switch between     the split-screen task and other fullscreen tasks.          So if the IME shown on the fullscreen task, when quick switch to     the split-screen task, basically the expected result will be IME     attached on the fullscreen task then won't expect IME moved to the     split-screen task.          However, the issue case is that seen the IME flicker on top of the     split-screen task and then disappeared.          The root case is in DC#computeImeParent didn't consider to not change     the new IME surface parent while the next IME input target has not yet     updated and settled the new IME visiblity, so IME may flicker if     changing the new IME parent too early.     (Typically the IME parent will be on the root displayArea when the     next target task is in multi-window mode)          We do defer changing IME parent from CL[1] when shouldImeAttachedToApp is     true, but this check didn't applied when switching to the split-screen     task, because shouldImeAttachedToApp will be false when the next IME     layering taget is in multi-window mode.          Simply move the above defer update IME parent logic out from     shouldImeAttachedToApp check to fix this IME flicker issue.          Also, remove shouldImeAttachedToApp check in     InsetsPolicy#adjustVisibilityForIme when the window is in insets frozen     state waiting for the next input started. Since there is no strong     reason to froze IME insets only when switching on fullscreen tasks.

"Cap alpha to max if SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE          As part of go/untrusted-touches for S, we blocked touches from passing     windows of different UIDs regardless of targetSdk. For SAWs, we applied     an opacity rule where apps would be able to let touches pass through     (usually via FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE) as long as their cumulative opacity in     the touch area wasn't greater than 0.8.          This resulted in some overlay apps being broken, which we expected and     saw to some extent in df/dp/beta, but we had reached out and some apps     fixed the issue. But the issue seems to be more widespread and OEM has     escalated the issue, reporting it to be affecting them more severely     (see bug).          So, we automatically make SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE windows have 20%     transparency to try to honor FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE and let touches pass     through. Note that if the app has overlapping windows the cumulative     opacity would be taken into consideration and the touch could still be     blocked, but none among the apps I checked did that.

"Cap alpha to max if SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE          As part of go/untrusted-touches for S, we blocked touches from passing     windows of different UIDs regardless of targetSdk. For SAWs, we applied     an opacity rule where apps would be able to let touches pass through     (usually via FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE) as long as their cumulative opacity in     the touch area wasn't greater than 0.8.          This resulted in some overlay apps being broken, which we expected and     saw to some extent in df/dp/beta, but we had reached out and some apps     fixed the issue. But the issue seems to be more widespread and OEM has     escalated the issue, reporting it to be affecting them more severely     (see bug).          So, we automatically make SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE windows have 20%     transparency to try to honor FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE and let touches pass     through. Note that if the app has overlapping windows the cumulative     opacity would be taken into consideration and the touch could still be     blocked, but none among the apps I checked did that.

"consolidate point where adb is enabled for test harness mode          test harness mode relies on enabling adb upon boot. however, currently,     there appears to be a race condition when enabling adb. test harness     mode enables adb in phase_boot_completed, and adb sets itself up in     phase_activity_manager_ready, both by writing a setting. it appears that     sometimes, the setting for initializing adb's state commits *after* the     setting to enable adb for test harness mode, which means that adb turns     on for a brief moment, then off until the device is manually fixed.          this changes it so that the adbservice checks the test harness mode     property when initializing adb state, always enabling adb on boot if     test harness mode is enabled.          bug: 232813060     test: tested with user and userdebug builds, both enable adb correctly     change-id: i518415dda275bc3d563820ead611e5f017368c95     ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]","1","0","0"

"treat failure to create a process group as fatal          during process startup, system creates a process group and places the     new process in it. if process group creation fails for some reason, the     new child process will stay in its parent's group. this poses danger     when the child is being frozen because the whole group is affected and     its parent is being frozen as well. considering that the parent of an     app is zygote, freezing it leads to the device becoming unusable.     fix this by treating group creation failure as a fatal error which would     prevent the app from starting. when system_server fails to create a     process group, it will throw an exception that's not caught and will     self-destruct.          bug: 227395690     test: fake group creation failure and confirm app failure to start     signed-off-by: suren baghdasaryan <surenb@google.com>     change-id: ib34b4a100c65a9a2705aaef8e7e32322fbedc531     ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]","1","0","0"

"improve efficiency of boundedbreakiteratorscanner fragmentation algorithm (#89041)          as discussed in #73569 the current implementation is too slow in certain scenarios.          the inefficient part of the code can be stated as the following problem:          given a text (gettext()) and a position in this text (offset), find the sentence     boundary before and after the offset, in such a way that the after boundary is     maximal but respects end boundary - start boundary < fragment size.          in case it's impossible to produce an after boundary that respects the said     condition, use the nearest boundary following offset.          the current approach begins by finding the nearest preceding and following boundaries,     and expands the following boundary greedily while it respects the problem restriction. this     is fine asymptotically, but breakiterator which is used to find each boundary is sometimes     expensive.          this new approach maximizes the after boundary by scanning for the last boundary     preceding the position that would cause the condition to be violated (i.e. knowing start     boundary and offset, how many characters are left before resulting length is fragment size).     if this scan finds the start boundary, it means it's impossible to satisfy the problem     restriction, and we get the first boundary following offset instead (or better, since we     already scanned [offset, targetendoffset], start from targetendoffset + 1).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 10, 0, 6, 3, 0]",1,1,1

"fix renaming data streams with ccr replication (#88875)          this commit fixes the situation where a user wants to use ccr to replicate indices that are part of     a data stream while renaming the data stream. for example, assume a user has an auto-follow request     that looks like this:          ```     put /_ccr/auto_follow/my-auto-follow-pattern     {     `remote_cluster` : `other-cluster`,     `leader_index_patterns` : [`logs-*`],     `follow_index_pattern` : `{{leader_index}}_copy`     }     ```          and then the data stream `logs-mysql-error` was created, creating the backing index     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001`.          prior to this commit, replicating this data stream means that the backing index would be renamed to     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001_copy` and the data stream would *not* be renamed. this     caused a check to trip in `transportputlifecycleaction` asserting that a backing index was not     renamed for a data stream during following.          after this commit, there are a couple of changes:          first, the data stream will also be renamed. this means that the `logs-mysql-error` becomes     `logs-mysql-error_copy` when created on the follower cluster. because of the way that ccr works,     this means we need to support renaming a data stream for a regular `create follower` request, so a     new parameter has been added: `data_stream_name`. it works like this:          ```     put /mynewindex/_ccr/follow     {     `remote_cluster`: `other-cluster`,     `leader_index`: `myotherindex`,     `data_stream_name`: `new_ds`     }     ```          second, the backing index for a data stream must be renamed in a way that does not break the parsing     of a data stream backing pattern, whereas previously the index     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001` would be renamed to     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001_copy` (an illegal name since it doesn't end with the     rollover digit), after this commit it will be renamed to     `.ds-logs-mysql-error_copy-2022-07-29-000001` to match the renamed data stream. this means that for     the given `follow_index_pattern` of `{{leader_index}}_copy` the index changes look like:          | leader cluster | follower cluster |     |--------------|-----------|     | `logs-mysql-error` (data stream) | `logs-mysql-error_copy` (data stream) |     | `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001`      | `.ds-logs-mysql-error_copy-2022-07-29-000001` |          which internally means the auto-follow request turned into the create follower request of:          ```     put /.ds-logs-mysql-error_copy-2022-07-29-000001/_ccr/follow     {     `remote_cluster`: `other-cluster`,     `leader_index`: `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001`,     `data_stream_name`: `logs-mysql-error_copy`     }     ```          relates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/84940 (cherry-picked the commit for a test)     relates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61993 (where data stream support was first introduced for ccr)     resolves https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/81751","[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 12, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 22, 20, 0, 1, 11, 0]",1,0,0

"fix missing intermediate object error when applying dynamic template (#87622)          when we apply dynamic mappings, we iterate over all the dynamic mappers retrieved from the documentparsercontext, which are registered while parsing the document, and for each field look up their parent (going back multiple levels if necessary), and add it to the dynamic mapping update with the added/modified sub-field.          dynamic mappers that are iterated through consist of a flat set of mappers, which can be both object mappers or field mappers. most times, the object mappers from such set have no sub-fields as they are mapped as a result of parsing a document where the object appears for the first time, which also has sub-fields that are going to be added to the set of dynamic mappers themselves once they are parsed.          there are scenarios though where a dynamic template matches an object, and defines its structure including its subobjects as well as sub-fields. in that case the dynamically mapped object may hold sub-fields as well as define non-default values for dynamic, enabled or subobjects. the described situation was not well covered in tests so far, and is currently affected by a bug introduced with #81449. when an object mapper is dynamically mapped, it is added to the map of dynamic object mappers, which makes it discoverable for sub-fields that will need to be added to it later, as well as to the set of dynamic mappers so that it becomes part of the mappings in case the document being parsed defines no sub-fields for it. what is missing is to recursively add its sub-fields to the dynamic object mappers. as a result of missing this step, intermediate objects that were dynamically mapped are not made discoverable which causes a cryptic `missing intermediate object` error.          this commit fixed the problem by recursively registering inner sub-objects to the dynamic mappers whenever an object mapper is added to the dynamic mappers. it also changes the `missing intermediate object` error to make it more evident that it's an internal error and not a user error: it is now an illegalstateexception instead of an illegalargumentexception.          closes #87513","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",1,0,0

"implement write throttling in netty4httppipelininghandler (#86922)          a step towards chunked rest encoding that only serializes chunks that     can be written right away and an optimization in isolation. a follow-up to this change will be able to use the flush + writability hooks introduced here to do serialization lazily and in chunks. this change was extracted into its own pr because it is somewhat complex for one but also because it provides performance benefits in isolation.          introduces the concept of queuing writes in the handler once a channel becomes unwritable     to the `netty4httppipelininghandler`. doing this reduces the memory consumption of compressed     responses as well as their first byte latency by only compressing chunks of a message     that can be written to the channel directly. prior to this change, all chunks would be compressed     first before any writes to the channel, wasting buffers that can't be written yet as well as     making the write to the channel wait until compression completed.     a further advantage of this change is that a large rest response will not block the transport thread     for a long compression operation any longer as it does today.          the implementation of writability and flush hooks in `netty4httppipelininghandler` has been intentionally coded in a similar fashion to that in `netty4writethrottlinghandler` (albeit it is much simpler because we do not chunk individual messages on the byte level in it) to allow for some drying up of the logic in a follow-up.

[ml] adjust automatic jvm heap sizing for dedicated ml nodes (#86399)          previously the jvm heap size on dedicated ml nodes was as follows     when automatic jvm heap sizing was used:          - 40% of memory if total memory < 2gb     - 25% of memory for total memory between 2gb and 8gb     - 2gb if total memory > 8gb          this formula had two major drawbacks:          1. there was no way to increase the ml node jvm size beyond 2gb.     if for some reason 2gb wasn't enough (e.g. a huge cluster state)     then there was no workaround.     2. the formula was not reversible - there are jvm heap sizes that     could arise from 2 different total memory sizes. this complicated     autoscaling calculations.          this pr switches to a simpler formula that does not suffer these     drawbacks. the new formula is:          jvm heap size = 40% of total memory up to 16gb     + 10% of total memory over 16gb          this is always rounded down to the next lower whole megabyte to     match what's done for other node types.          it's now possible to increase the jvm heap size on dedicated ml nodes     indefinitely by increasing the node size. and there are no nasty     discontinuities in the formula that make the inverse hard to calculate.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 14, 0, 3, 7, 0, 0, 19, 88, 10, 14, 16, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 4, 1, 5, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 45, 151, 14, 30, 236, 0]",1,1,1

avoid implicitly setting class initialization reason for classes/packages          when marking a class `my.package.myclass` for initialization for a given     reason before this patch `my` and `my.package` would also be assigned     the reason implicitly.  this resulted in reporting the wrong reason in     some cases.  for instance before this patch     `java.lang.abstractstringbuilder` would be marked as initialized because     it's a `super type of sun.security.util.untrustedcertificates` which is     clearly not the case.  this patch fixes the underlying problem and     reports `core jdk classes are initialized at build time` as the reason     for initializing `abstractstringbuilder` at `build_time`.     ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]",1,0,0

"Provide tracing implementation using OpenTelemetry +  APM agent (#88443)          Part of #84369. Implement the `Tracer` interface by providing a     module that uses OpenTelemetry, along with Elastic's APM     agent for Java.          See the file `TRACING.md` for background on the changes and the     reasoning for some of the implementation decisions.          The configuration mechanism is the most fiddly part of this PR. The     Security Manager permissions required by the APM Java agent make     it prohibitive to start an agent from within Elasticsearch     programmatically, so it must be configured when the ES JVM starts.     That means that the startup CLI needs to assemble the required JVM     options.          To complicate matters further, the APM agent needs a secret token     in order to ship traces to the APM server. We can't use Java system     properties to configure this, since otherwise the secret will be     readable to all code in Elasticsearch. It therefore has to be     configured in a dedicated config file. This in itself is awkward,     since we don't want to leave secrets in config files. Therefore,     we pull the APM secret token from the keystore, write it to a config     file, then delete the config file after ES starts.          There's a further issue with the config file. Any options we set     in the APM agent config file cannot later be reconfigured via system     properties, so we need to make sure that only `static` configuration     goes into the config file.          I generated most of the files under `qa/apm` using an APM test     utility (I can't remember which one now, unfortunately).

"Improve efficiency of BoundedBreakIteratorScanner fragmentation algorithm (#89041)          As discussed in #73569 the current implementation is too slow in certain scenarios.          The inefficient part of the code can be stated as the following problem:          Given a text (getText()) and a position in this text (offset), find the sentence     boundary before and after the offset, in such a way that the after boundary is     maximal but respects end boundary - start boundary < fragment size.          In case it's impossible to produce an after boundary that respects the said     condition, use the nearest boundary following offset.          The current approach begins by finding the nearest preceding and following boundaries,     and expands the following boundary greedily while it respects the problem restriction. This     is fine asymptotically, but BreakIterator which is used to find each boundary is sometimes     expensive.          This new approach maximizes the after boundary by scanning for the last boundary     preceding the position that would cause the condition to be violated (i.e. knowing start     boundary and offset, how many characters are left before resulting length is fragment size).     If this scan finds the start boundary, it means it's impossible to satisfy the problem     restriction, and we get the first boundary following offset instead (or better, since we     already scanned [offset, targetEndOffset], start from targetEndOffset + 1).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 10, 0, 6, 3, 0]",1,1,1

"[ML] Previously assigned models should get at least one allocation (#88855)          When for some reason ML nodes are replaced (cluster resize, upgrade, etc.),     it is possible that some models cannot be allocated at all. Then, while     the cluster is temporarily undersized, all cores are given for allocations     of the models that have survived. If those ML nodes return later, there may     be model deployments that were previously allocated that now do not get any     allocations. The reason is that our planner will try to preserve all current     allocations.          Operationally, this is not what serves best our users. Instead, as we are     already in a cluster that does not have enough resources to fully allocate     all model deployments, we should try to give at least one allocation to each     model that has previously been allocated.          In order to know a model has previously been allocated, this commit adds a field     to `TrainedModelAssignment` called `max_assigned_allocations` which records the     max number of allocations a deployment has received in its life. We can then use     this to establish whether a deployment has ever been allocated.          Finally, we modify the `AssignmentPlanner` so that after computing a plan we     check whether the plan gives at least one allocation to all previously allocated models.     If not, we then compute a plan that tries to give at least one allocation to each     previously allocated model. We can solve this just using bin-packing. Having that     plan we can invoke the planner one more time to optimize the rest of the allocations     whilst preserving the single allocations for previously allocated models.

For example, assume a user has an auto-follow request     that looks like this:          ```     PUT /_ccr/auto_follow/my-auto-follow-pattern     {     `remote_cluster` : `other-cluster`,     `leader_index_patterns` : [`logs-*`],     `follow_index_pattern` : `{{leader_index}}_copy`     }     ```          And then the data stream `logs-mysql-error` was created, creating the backing index     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001`.          Prior to this commit, replicating this data stream means that the backing index would be renamed to     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001_copy` and the data stream would *not* be renamed. This     caused a check to trip in `TransportPutLifecycleAction` asserting that a backing index was not     renamed for a data stream during following.          After this commit, there are a couple of changes:          First, the data stream will also be renamed. This means that the `logs-mysql-error` becomes     `logs-mysql-error_copy` when created on the follower cluster. Because of the way that CCR works,     this means we need to support renaming a data stream for a regular `create follower` request, so a     new parameter has been added: `data_stream_name`. It works like this:          ```     PUT /mynewindex/_ccr/follow     {     `remote_cluster`: `other-cluster`,     `leader_index`: `myotherindex`,     `data_stream_name`: `new_ds`     }     ```          Second, the backing index for a data stream must be renamed in a way that does not break the parsing     of a data stream backing pattern, whereas previously the index     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001` would be renamed to     `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001_copy` (an illegal name since it doesn't end with the     rollover digit), after this commit it will be renamed to     `.ds-logs-mysql-error_copy-2022-07-29-000001` to match the renamed data stream. This means that for     the given `follow_index_pattern` of `{{leader_index}}_copy` the index changes look like:          | Leader Cluster | Follower Cluster |     |--------------|-----------|     | `logs-mysql-error` (data stream) | `logs-mysql-error_copy` (data stream) |     | `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001`      | `.ds-logs-mysql-error_copy-2022-07-29-000001` |          Which internally means the auto-follow request turned into the create follower request of:          ```     PUT /.ds-logs-mysql-error_copy-2022-07-29-000001/_ccr/follow     {     `remote_cluster`: `other-cluster`,     `leader_index`: `.ds-logs-mysql-error-2022-07-29-000001`,     `data_stream_name`: `logs-mysql-error_copy`     }     ```          Relates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/84940 (cherry-picked the commit for a test)     Relates to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61993 (where data stream support was first introduced for CCR)     Resolves https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/81751","[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 12, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 22, 20, 0, 1, 11, 0]",1,1,1

Fix `physicalFiles` containing the same `FileInfo` instances repeatedly for every     snapshot that holds the file. Without this fix the map can hold lists as long as the     number of snapshots for the shard for files common to all snapshots of the shard.     Also, only lazy build the map since it's only used during snapshotting and internalize     the logic into `BlobStoreIndexShardSnapshots` so we don't have to bother with wrapping     as unmodifiable.     2. Add efficient copy constructors for all 3 operations on the shard to avoid     expensive looping over all snapshots and their files in many cases.     3.

"[ML] Rebalance model assignments when outdated assignments exist (#88761)          When a cluster has been updated from a version prior to the version     when distributed model allocation was introduced (8.4), there is     a possibility that after the full cluster has been upgraded there     still are assignments with routing entries that have `current_allocations`     and `target_allocations` equal to `0`. Those are outdated and we     should trigger a rebalance in order to apply the new distributed     model allocation.

"[ML] add new cache_size parameter to trained_model deployments API (#88450)          With: https://github.com/elastic/ml-cpp/pull/2305 we now support caching pytorch inference responses per node per model.          By default, the cache will be the same size has the model on disk size. This is because our current best estimate for memory used (for deploying) is 2*model_size + constant_overhead.          This is due to the model having to be loaded in memory twice when serializing to the native process.          But, once the model is in memory and accepting requests, its actual memory usage is reduced vs. what we have `reserved` for it within the node.          Consequently, having a cache layer that takes advantage of that unused (but reserved) memory is effectively free. When used in production, especially in search scenarios, caching inference results is critical for decreasing latency.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 33, 0, 0, 36, 0]",1,1,1

(#88258)          `IndexMode#getConfiguredTimestampRange(...)` functionally overlaps a lot     with `IndexMode#getTimestampBound(...)`. In order to reuse     `IndexMode#getTimestampBound(...)` for the use case     `IndexMode#getConfiguredTimestampRange(...)` is reused a change had to     be made to TimestampBounds.

"Support updates of API key attributes [service layer] (#87924)          Service level implementation to add support for updating attributes of     existing API keys. This allows end-users to modify privileges and     metadata associated with API keys dynamically, without requiring     rolling out new API keys every time there is a change.          Updatable attributes are role_descriptors and metadata. Several     other attributes are updated automatically, on every update call,     including limited_by_role_descriptors, creator, and version. API     key attributes are replaced, not merged.          On every update, the API key doc cache is cleared for the updated API     key.

"Speed up synthetic keyword, ip, and text fields (#87930)          This speeds up synthetic source, especially when there are many fields     in the index that are declared in the mapping but don't have values.     This is fairly common with ECS, and the tsdb rally track uses that. And     this improves fetch performance of that track:     ```     |  50th percentile service time |    default |   6.24029 |  4.85568 | ms | -22.19% |     |  90th percentile service time |    default |   7.89923 |  6.52069 | ms | -17.45% |     |  99th percentile service time |    default |  12.0306  | 16.435   | ms | +36.61% |     | 100th percentile service time |    default |  14.2873  | 17.1175  | ms | +19.81% |     |  50th percentile service time | default_1k | 158.425   | 25.3236  | ms | -84.02% |     |  90th percentile service time | default_1k | 165.46    | 30.8655  | ms | -81.35% |     |  99th percentile service time | default_1k | 168.954   | 33.3342  | ms | -80.27% |     | 100th percentile service time | default_1k | 174.341   | 34.8344  | ms | -80.02% |     ```          There's a slight increase in the 99th and 100th percentile service time     for fetching ten document which think is unlucky jitter. Hopefully. The     average performance of fetching ten docs improves anyway so I think     we're ok. Fetching a thousand documents improves 80% across the board     which is lovely.          This works by doing three things:     1. Teach the `leaf` layer of source loader to detect when the field is     empty in that segment and remove it from the synthesis process     entirely. This brings most of the speed up in tsdb.     2. Replace `hasValue` with a callback when writing the first value.     `hasValue` was resulting in a 2^n-like number of calls that really     showed up in the profiler.     3. Replace the `ArrayList` of leaf loaders with an array. Before fixing     the other two issues the `ArrayList`'s iterator really showed up in     the profiling. Probably much less worth it now, but it's small.          All of this brings synthetic source much closer to the fetch performance     of standard _source:     ```     |  50th percentile service time | default_1k |  11.4016  | 25.3236  | ms | +122.11% |     |  90th percentile service time | default_1k |  13.7212  | 30.8655  | ms | +124.95% |     |  99th percentile service time | default_1k |  15.8785  | 33.3342  | ms | +109.93% |     | 100th percentile service time | default_1k |  16.9715  | 34.8344  | ms | +105.25% |     ```          One important thing, these perf numbers come from fetching *hot* blocks     on disk.

"Speed up synthetic source (#87882)          This speeds up synthetic source, especially when there are many fields     in the index that are declared in the mapping but don't have values.     This is fairly common with ECS, and the tsdb rally track uses that. And     this improves fetch performance of that track:          ```     |  50th percentile service time |    default |   6.24029 |  4.85568 | ms | -22.19% |     |  90th percentile service time |    default |   7.89923 |  6.52069 | ms | -17.45% |     |  99th percentile service time |    default |  12.0306  | 16.435   | ms | +36.61% |     | 100th percentile service time |    default |  14.2873  | 17.1175  | ms | +19.81% |     |  50th percentile service time | default_1k | 158.425   | 25.3236  | ms | -84.02% |     |  90th percentile service time | default_1k | 165.46    | 30.8655  | ms | -81.35% |     |  99th percentile service time | default_1k | 168.954   | 33.3342  | ms | -80.27% |     | 100th percentile service time | default_1k | 174.341   | 34.8344  | ms | -80.02% |     ```          There's a slight increase in the 99th and 100th percentile service time     for fetching ten document which think is unlucky jitter. Hopefully. The     average performance of fetching ten docs improves anyway so I think     we're ok. Fetching a thousand documents improves 80% across the board     which is lovely.          This works by doing three things: 1. Teach the `leaf` layer of source     loader to detect when the field is    empty in that segment and remove     it from the synthesis process    entirely. This brings most of the speed     up in tsdb. 2. Replace `hasValue` with `advanceToDoc` returning     `boolean` and     cache the result. 3. Replace the `ArrayList` of leaf     loaders with an array. Before fixing    the other two issues the     `ArrayList`'s iterator really showed up in    the profiling. Probably     much less worth it now, but it's small.          All of this brings synthetic source much closer to the fetch performance     of standard _source:          ```     |  50th percentile service time | default_1k |  11.4016  | 25.3236  | ms | +122.11% |     |  90th percentile service time | default_1k |  13.7212  | 30.8655  | ms | +124.95% |     |  99th percentile service time | default_1k |  15.8785  | 33.3342  | ms | +109.93% |     | 100th percentile service time | default_1k |  16.9715  | 34.8344  | ms | +105.25% |     ```          One important thing, these perf numbers come from fetching *hot* blocks     on disk.

"Use desired nodes during data tier allocation decisions  (#87735)          Today when the DataTierAllocationDecider checks if a shard can be allocated     in a node or not it uses the current cluster topology.

"Simplify bootstrap error logging (#87809)          During startup of Elasticsearch we go to great lengths to present errors     in a meaningful way to users. Over time, though, the error handling has     been amended to address various issues, and that has resulted in a     complicated system of try/catches handling various cases. One     particularly kludgy piece is removing the console logger in special     cases to avoid printing exceptions to the console. Additionally, the     console removal wasn't actually effective because later in exception     handling the exception would be both logged anyways, and then also sent     to stderr, meaning that we could see the same exception several times.          This commit reworks how exceptions are logged during bootstrap. To     address the concern of printing full exceptions to the console, a new     log4j exception filter is added to the console appender which will only     print out the exception message and some additional explanatory info. To     address logging multiple times, the try/catch within init is removed so     that excpetions can propagate to the try/catch in main, which now     handles all exceptions. Additionally, phase 1 (before logging) handles     it's own failure cases since there is definitely no logging at that     time.

"Fix missing intermediate object error when applying dynamic template (#87622)          When we apply dynamic mappings, we iterate over all the dynamic mappers retrieved from the DocumentParserContext, which are registered while parsing the document, and for each field look up their parent (going back multiple levels if necessary), and add it to the dynamic mapping update with the added/modified sub-field.          Dynamic mappers that are iterated through consist of a flat set of mappers, which can be both object mappers or field mappers. Most times, the object mappers from such set have no sub-fields as they are mapped as a result of parsing a document where the object appears for the first time, which also has sub-fields that are going to be added to the set of dynamic mappers themselves once they are parsed.          There are scenarios though where a dynamic template matches an object, and defines its structure including its subobjects as well as sub-fields. In that case the dynamically mapped object may hold sub-fields as well as define non-default values for dynamic, enabled or subobjects. The described situation was not well covered in tests so far, and is currently affected by a bug introduced with #81449. When an object mapper is dynamically mapped, it is added to the map of dynamic object mappers, which makes it discoverable for sub-fields that will need to be added to it later, as well as to the set of dynamic mappers so that it becomes part of the mappings in case the document being parsed defines no sub-fields for it. What is missing is to recursively add its sub-fields to the dynamic object mappers. As a result of missing this step, intermediate objects that were dynamically mapped are not made discoverable which causes a cryptic `Missing intermediate object` error.          This commit fixed the problem by recursively registering inner sub-objects to the dynamic mappers whenever an object mapper is added to the dynamic mappers. It also changes the `missing intermediate object` error to make it more evident that it's an internal error and not a user error: it is now an IllegalStateException instead of an IllegalArgumentException.

"Don't run include_in_parent when in copy_to context (#87123)          We changed how copy_to is implemented in #79922, which moved     the handling of dots in field names into a specialised parser. Unfortunately,     while doing this we added a bug whereby every time a copy_to directive     is processed for a nested field, the nested field's include_in_parent logic     would be run, meaning that the parent would end up with multiple copies     of the nested child's fields.

"Use Map in SegmentStats (#87307)          SegmentStats has an ImmutableOpenMap tracking the files that exist     within an index segment. This commit converts the member to a Map.

"Simplify master task failure handling (#86970)          Today a batching executor must submit an `ActionListener<ClusterState>`     for every task in the batch that succeeds.

"Implement write throttling in Netty4HttpPipeliningHandler (#86922)          A step towards chunked rest encoding that only serializes chunks that     can be written right away and an optimization in isolation. A follow-up to this change will be able to use the flush + writability hooks introduced here to do serialization lazily and in chunks. This change was extracted into its own PR because it is somewhat complex for one but also because it provides performance benefits in isolation.          Introduces the concept of queuing writes in the handler once a channel becomes unwritable     to the `Netty4HttpPipeliningHandler`. Doing this reduces the memory consumption of compressed     responses as well as their first byte latency by only compressing chunks of a message     that can be written to the channel directly. Prior to this change, all chunks would be compressed     first before any writes to the channel, wasting buffers that can't be written yet as well as     making the write to the channel wait until compression completed.     A further advantage of this change is that a large REST response will not block the transport thread     for a long compression operation any longer as it does today.          The implementation of writability and flush hooks in `Netty4HttpPipeliningHandler` has been intentionally coded in a similar fashion to that in `Netty4WriteThrottlingHandler` (albeit it is much simpler because we do not chunk individual messages on the byte level in it) to allow for some drying up of the logic in a follow-up.

"Fix resolution of wildcard application privileges (#87293)          Previously, a role with application privileges of          {     `application`: `*`,     `privileges`: [`*`]     `resources`: [`*`]     }          would be resolved to mean every _defined_ privilege in every _defined_     application (subject to condition 1 described below).          This implementation was based on the assumption that every action that     would ever be checked by _has_privileges would be explicitly defined     as an application privilege (via PUT /_security/privilege)          That assumption would have been fine if not for 2 discrepancies          1. The resolved privileges were then filtered by privilege name and     wildcards were not respected. So the role shown above would     actually filter down to nothing. However if the user had another     role with named privileges (not wildcards) then the filtering would     include that privilege _if it was defined_.          2. The logic to construct a runtime ApplicationPrivilege from the     resolved ApplicationPrivilegeDescriptor instances had special case     logic to handle 0 matching descriptors. This was needed so that     superuser always had every privilege, even if the descriptors had     not yet been defined, or where unavailable for some reason. However     because this logic only applied if there were no matching     descriptors the behaviour was inconsistent. For the most part it     would look like wildcard application privileges functioned     correctly even when no application privileges were defined, but     this behaviour could not be relied on if the user had additional     roles that references defined application privileges (per point 1).          This change solves point 2, by always including the wildcard     permission even if there are matching descriptors.

However, it is not necessary in practice because:          1. The field `realm` in authentication_success event is for BWC purpose.     Hence we don't need pair it with domain.     2. API Keys cannot be under any domain.     3. No need to audit domain for authentication_failed events because no     authorization is possible in these cases.

"Fields API to allow fetching values when _source is disabled (#87267)          Back when we introduced the fields parameter to the search API, it could only fetch values from _source, hence     the corresponding sub-fetch phase fails early whenever _source is disabled.

Previously, datafeed previews would always start at 0 (or from the beginning of the data).

"[Refactor] Move classpath plugins to MockNode (#86914)          We only use classpath plugins in tests, so we should move code handling them to     our test framework. This PR introduces a new MockPluginsService in our test     framework. The MockPluginsService is constructed with a list of classpath     plugins that it will load by reflection. As before, these classpath plugins     won't have their own classloaders.          We have to construct the pluginsService early in the Node class constructor so     that MockNode methods can access it, but we have to do it after Node updates     its Settings argument. Therefore, instead of passing in classpath plugins as a     paramater, we are passing in a constructor function that takes a Settings     argument and returns a PluginsService. This lets us remove the classpath plugin     list from the production code entirely.          The MockPluginsService delegates almost everything to a real PluginsService,     overriding only the protected plugins() method and the info() method.          This commit also changes the PluginDescriptor.equals() method.

"Modularize Elasticsearch (#81066)          This PR represents the initial phase of Modularizing Elasticsearch (with     Java Modules).          This initial phase modularizes the core of the Elasticsearch server     with Java Modules, which is then used to load and configure extension     components atop the server. Only a subset of extension components are     modularized at this stage (other components come in a later phase).     Components are loaded dynamically at runtime with custom class loaders     (same as is currently done). Components with a module-info.class are     defined to a module layer.          This architecture is somewhat akin to the Modular JDK, where     applications run on the classpath. In the analogy, the Elasticsearch     server modules are the platform (thus are always resolved and present),     while components without a module-info.class are non-modular code     running atop the Elasticsearch server modules. The extension components     cannot access types from non-exported packages of the server modules, in     the same way that classpath applications cannot access types from     non-exported packages of modules from the JDK. Broadly, the core     Elasticseach java modules simply `wrap` the existing packages and export     them. There are opportunites to export less, which is best done in more     narrowly focused follow-up PRs.          The Elasticsearch distribution startup scripts are updated to put jars     on the module path (the class path is empty), so the distribution will     run the core of the server as java modules. A number of key components     have been retrofitted with module-info.java's too, and the remaining     components can follow later. Unit and functional tests run as     non-modular (since they commonly require package-private access), while     higher-level integration tests, that run the distribution, run as     modular.

"Add support for CPU ranges in desired nodes (#86434)          This commit adds support for CPU ranges in the desired nodes API.

"Replace most shell script logic with Java (#85758)          Elasticsearch provides several command line tools, as well as the main script to start elasticsearch. While most of the logic is abstracted away for cli tools, the main elasticsearch script has hundreds of lines of platform specific shell code. That code is difficult to maintain because it uses many special shell features which then must also exist in other platforms (ie windows batch files). Additionally, the logic in these scripts are not easy to test, we must be on the actual platform and test with a full installation of Elasticsearch, which is relatively slow (compared to most in process tests).          This commit replaces logic of the main server script, as well as the windows service management script, with Java. The new entrypoints use the CliToolLauncher. The server cli figures out all the jvm options and such necessary, then launches the real server process. If run in the foreground, the launcher will stay alive for the lifetime of Elasticsearch; the streams are effectively inherited so all output from Elasticsearch still goes to the console. If daemonizing, the launcher waits around until Elasticsearch is `ready` (this means the Node startup completed), then detaches and exits.

"Add a Gradle Plugin for compiling modular source projects. (#86602)          This PR upstreams a custom Gradle Plugin for compiling modular source     projects, that we've been using for a while now over on the modules     branch. The Plugin infers which dependencies should be on the module     path and which dependencies should be on the class path, when compilng     the main java sourceset. This supports the `bottom up` modularization of     Elasticsearch, where parent projects are modularized before child     projects. Allowing to modularize the core of the server independently of     the extension components, that can themselves be modularized later.          With this plugin various subprojects can be modularized (by adding a     module-info.java in the source root) with minimal fuss - no custom     gradle logic is required by the subproject, beyond a couple of     subproject specific compiler lint suppressions.          The inference in the plugin is driven by walking the project     dependencies, searching for the presence of a module-info.java,     afterwhich all subprojects will be put on the module path. Again, this     supports `bottom up` modularization.

"Add annotation for disabling security manager in tests (#86706)          The Elasticsearch test framework initializes a test security manager, so     that tests run in a similar environment to that which we run in     production. However, some tests need to run without security manager     because they do `evil` things, like setting adding and removing jvm wide     shutdown hooks. Currently these tests must exist in separate projects,     mostly under qa/evil-tests, so that the security manager can be disabled     for the entire jvm with the tests.security.manager system property. The     separation between these tests and the other tests for the server makes     development of these tests more difficult, especially the inability to run     these within IntelliJ without manually adding additional sysprops.          This commit adds a new mechanism to disable security manager for these     tests. A new `@NoSecurityManager` annotation can be added to a test     suite. ESTestCase detects this annotation and removes the security     manager for the duration of that test suite.

TSDB: Initial reindex fix  (#86647)          It turns out that there is a fairly simple recipe for reindexing to a     `time_series` index:     1. If you are reindexing from a time series index to a time series index     and *not* changing the `@timestamp` or dimensions it `just     works`(TM).     2. If you are reindexing from a standard index with a standard random     `_id` you should clear it on reindex.     3. If you are reindexing from tsdb index to a tsdb index and modifying a     dimension or `@timestamp` then you should clear the `_id`.          This is not pleasant to have to remember. But it doesn't crash!          * TSDB: Initial reindex fix          This teaches reindex the smallest thing that it needs to know about     tsdb: `_id` is automatically generated. Armed with that knowledge     reindex now doesn't attempt to copy the `_id` when writing to a tsdb     index.

"Disable get API on legacy indices (#86594)          The get API relies under the hood on accessing postings to lookup the _id and retrieve the corresponding document.

"Block joins while applier is busy (#84919)          Certain cluster appliers perform I/O or other heavy computations and in     extreme circumstances may take a significant amount of time to apply a     cluster state. The master considers a node to be unhealthy if it takes     too long to apply a cluster state. Nodes that time out like this are     removed from the cluster, but they will carry on with the slow cluster     state application regardless. If the application takes long enough then     there may be time for the node to rejoin the cluster, time out applying     the state resulting from the rejoin, and be removed again. This can     happen repeatedly and is disruptive to the rest of the cluster.          There is no point in trying to rejoin the cluster while the applier is     busy. With this commit we send the join request from the applier thread,     ensuring that it is not occupied with other work and will therefore be     available to apply the joining state.

"Fix min node version before state recovery (#86482)          We use the minimum node version in the cluster state to make decisions     about backwards compatibility (e.g. to choose newer actions in the REST     layer only if all nodes will support it). Once the cluster is fully     formed we reject attempts by older nodes to join the cluster so that the     minimum node version only ever increases, which makes     backwards-compatibility decisions safe.          However, it's possible that the REST layer will make decisions about     backwards compatibility before the cluster is fully formed. In this     state, older nodes may still join the cluster and may therefore see     actions that they do not understand.          With this commit we report no nodes to the REST layer until the cluster     is fully-formed, and change the minimum node version in an empty cluster     to be the minimum compatible version. This means the REST layer will     operate in a maximally-compatible mode until the cluster is formed.

"Has privileges API for profiles (#85898)          This introduces a new Security API `_security/profile/_has_privileges`     that can be used to verify which Users have the requested privileges,     given their associated User Profiles. Multiple profile uids can be specified     in a single has privileges request.          This is analogous to the existing Has privileges API. It also uses the same     format for specifying the privileges to be checked, and should be used in     the same situations (ie to run an authorization preflight check or to verify     privileges over application resources). However, unlike the existing     has privilege API, this can be used to check the privileges of multiple     users (not only of the currently authenticated one), but the users must     have an existing profile, and the response is binary only (either it has or     it does not have the requested privileges).

[ML] Adjust automatic JVM heap sizing for dedicated ML nodes (#86399)          Previously the JVM heap size on dedicated ML nodes was as follows     when automatic JVM heap sizing was used:          - 40% of memory if total memory < 2GB     - 25% of memory for total memory between 2GB and 8GB     - 2GB if total memory > 8GB          This formula had two major drawbacks:          1. There was no way to increase the ML node JVM size beyond 2GB.     If for some reason 2GB wasn't enough (e.g. a huge cluster state)     then there was no workaround.     2. The formula was not reversible - there are JVM heap sizes that     could arise from 2 different total memory sizes. This complicated     autoscaling calculations.          This PR switches to a simpler formula that does not suffer these     drawbacks. The new formula is:          JVM heap size = 40% of total memory up to 16GB     + 10% of total memory over 16GB          This is always rounded down to the next lower whole megabyte to     match what's done for other node types.

Avoid implicitly setting class initialization reason for classes/packages          When marking a class `my.package.MyClass` for initialization for a given     reason before this patch `my` and `my.package` would also be assigned     the reason implicitly.  This resulted in reporting the wrong reason in     some cases.  For instance before this patch     `java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder` would be marked as initialized because     it's a `super type of sun.security.util.UntrustedCertificates` which is     clearly not the case.

"Stop VPN profiles by exiting VpnRunner instead of prepareInternal          Change to call the VpnRunner.exit to stop vpn profile     instead of using prepareInternal to leave the package intact.     This aligns with the way that VpnServices are disconnected     so that the package and other related information will not be     reset unexpectedly.          In current design, Vpn will examine if the current prepared     package matches to prevent an existing always-on VPN from being     dethroned by other apps when the VPN always-on is enabled.     However, when the VPN is disabled using stopVpnProfile, the     current package name will be updated to [LEGACY VPN]. The     current package will no longer be the same with the VPN package.

It is written correctly, however, the parser currently is     unable to read the file that it wrote, meaning that:     1. ADB keys never properly expire     2. WiFi APs are never properly restored          Furthermore, because of complex interactions with restoring the adb_keys     file in Test Harness Mode, duplicate keys get appended repteatedly to     the adb_keys file if they're not in the key map.

"BaseBundle.java: Recycle underlying parcel when bundle is cleared.          Lazy Bundles, (aosp/1787847), introduced a change in behavior where a Parcel     created as part of initializing a Bundle is dependent on the next ART GC run to be     recycled, causing a short term memory-leak.          To land this in T, we are making the change targetted and allowing     consumers to opt into the parcel being immediately cleared by calling     .clear() on the bundle.          As part of the unparcel() in clear(), mParcelledData is set to null, and     mMap may or may not still contain references through lazy values,     depending on if the lazy valyes have been unmarshalled.  As     such, we keep a weak reference to mParcelledData we can use to recycle it.          The mParcelledData reference could have been copied to other bundles in     a few operations:     new Bundle(Bundle o)     bundle.deepCopy()     bundle.putAll()          In this case we can not recycle the parcel yet as other bundles may     still require it.

"UsageStatsService: ignore removed users in persistPendingEventsLocked()          If a pre-created user is removed before it becomes a full user, the     ACTION_USER_REMOVED intent is never sent, so UsageStatsService is never     notified that the user's pending events should be discarded.  It will     eventually try to persist the events.  As the first step, it tries to     create /data/system_de/$userId/usagestats and the parent directory     /data/system_de/$userId if it doesn't already exist.          However, due to https://r.android.com/2078213 the SELinux policy no     longer allows system_server to create /data/system_de/$userId.  The     failure to create this directory is causing UsageStatsService to throw     an IllegalStateException which crashes system_server.          (Before the sepolicy change, system_server could create     /data/system_de/$userId, so the crash wouldn't have happened.  But     problems still might have occurred if the user ID was reused.)          The underlying user state tracking bug still needs to be fixed.  For     now, just avoid crashing system_server unnecessarily, and avoid an     SELinux denial by using mkdir() instead of mkdirs().

"Consolidate point where ADB is enabled for Test Harness Mode          Test Harness Mode relies on enabling ADB upon boot.

"Ignore errors preparing user storage for existing users          Unfortunately we can't rule out the existence of devices where the user     storage wasn't properly prepared, due to StorageManagerService     previously ignoring errors from mVold.prepareUserStorage, combined with     OEMs potentially creating files in per-user directories too early.  And     forcing these broken devices to be factory reset upon taking an OTA is     not currently considered to be acceptable.          One option is to only check for prepareUserStorage errors on devices     that launched with T or later.  However, this is a serious issue and it     would be strongly preferable to do more than that.          Therefore, this CL makes it so that errors are checked for all new     users, rather than all new devices.  A field ignorePrepareStorageErrors     is added to the user record; it is only ever set to true implicitly,     when reading a user record from disk that lacks this field.  This field     is used by StorageManagerService to decide whether to check for errors.          Bug: 164488924     Bug: 224585613     Test: Intentionally made a device affected by this issue by reverting     the CLs that introduced the error checks, and changing vold to     inject an error into prepareUserStorage.   Then, flashed a build     with this CL without wiping userdata.  The device still boots, as     expected, and the log shows that the error was intentionally     ignored.  Tested that if a second user is added, the error is     *not* ignored and the second user's storage is destroyed before it     can be used.  Finally, wiped the device and verified that it won't     boot up anymore, as expected since error checking is enabled for     the system user in that case.

"UserDataPreparer: reboot to recovery for system user only          With the next CL, old devices might contain a combination of old users     with prepareUserStorage error checking disabled and new users with     prepareUserStorage error checking enabled.  Factory resetting the whole     device when any user fails to prepare may be too aggressive.  Also,     UserDataPreparer already destroys the affected user's storage when it     fails to prepare, which seems to be fairly effective at breaking things     for that user (absent proper error handling by upper layers).          Therefore, let's only factory reset the device if the failing user is     the system user.

"UserDataPreparer: reboot to recovery if preparing user storage fails          StorageManager.prepareUserStorage() can throw an exception if a     directory cannot be encrypted, for example due to already being     nonempty.

UserDataPreparer currently handles this by deleting the user's     directories, but the error is still ultimately suppressed and starting     the user is still allowed to proceed.          The correct behavior in this case is to reboot into recovery to ask the     user to factory reset the device.

"UserDataPreparer: fix volume preparation order          Internal storage must be prepared before adoptable storage, since the     user's volume keys are stored in their internal storage.  Previously,     the order depended on the Java hashcodes of the volume IDs.  It seems     that in practice things sort of worked out anyway even with the wrong     order, via a bizarre sequence of events involving the user's storage     being deleted and re-created several times.  Regardless, let's fix it.          destroyUserData() sort of had the reverse bug, although I don't think it     actually mattered.  My concern there was that destroying the internal     storage first would bypass vold's destroyKey() for the volume keys.     However, that's okay since the volume keys don't actually need a special     destruction procedure in this case.  Also, internal storage has already     been locked when destroyUserData() runs anyway.

This does mean that UsageStatsService now implements two types of     migrations, and that the source directory for one migration is the     target directory for the other, which is a bit unfortunate.

"Treat failure to create a process group as fatal          During process startup, system creates a process group and places the     new process in it. If process group creation fails for some reason, the     new child process will stay in its parent's group. This poses danger     when the child is being frozen because the whole group is affected and     its parent is being frozen as well. Considering that the parent of an     app is Zygote, freezing it leads to the device becoming unusable.     Fix this by treating group creation failure as a fatal error which would     prevent the app from starting.

"Disallow PAP authentication when MPPE is requested          MPPE cannot work if PAP is used as authentication, so it is not useful     to allow PAP authentication when MPPE is enforced: establishing the     tunnel would fail anyway with `MPPE required, but MS-CHAP[v2] auth not     performed`.

"RESTRICT AUTOMERGE: Polish IME transition from fullscreen task to split-screen task          As the new split-screen behavior that the root task of the split-screen     can be in the recents task, so using quick switch can switch between     the split-screen task and other fullscreen tasks.          So if the IME shown on the fullscreen task, when quick switch to     the split-screen task, basically the expected result will be IME     attached on the fullscreen task then won't expect IME moved to the     split-screen task.          However, the issue case is that seen the IME flicker on top of the     split-screen task and then disappeared.          The root case is in DC#computeImeParent didn't consider to not change     the new IME surface parent while the next IME input target has not yet     updated and settled the new IME visiblity, so IME may flicker if     changing the new IME parent too early.     (Typically the IME parent will be on the root displayArea when the     next target task is in multi-window mode)          We do defer changing IME parent from CL[1] when shouldImeAttachedToApp is     true, but this check didn't applied when switching to the split-screen     task, because shouldImeAttachedToApp will be false when the next IME     layering taget is in multi-window mode.          Simply move the above defer update IME parent logic out from     shouldImeAttachedToApp check to fix this IME flicker issue.          Also, remove shouldImeAttachedToApp check in     InsetsPolicy#adjustVisibilityForIme when the window is in insets frozen     state waiting for the next input started. Since there is no strong     reason to froze IME insets only when switching on fullscreen tasks.

"Cap alpha to max if SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE          As part of go/untrusted-touches for S, we blocked touches from passing     windows of different UIDs regardless of targetSdk. For SAWs, we applied     an opacity rule where apps would be able to let touches pass through     (usually via FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE) as long as their cumulative opacity in     the touch area wasn't greater than 0.8.          This resulted in some overlay apps being broken, which we expected and     saw to some extent in df/dp/beta, but we had reached out and some apps     fixed the issue. But the issue seems to be more widespread and OEM has     escalated the issue, reporting it to be affecting them more severely     (see bug).          So, we automatically make SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE windows have 20%     transparency to try to honor FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE and let touches pass     through. Note that if the app has overlapping windows the cumulative     opacity would be taken into consideration and the touch could still be     blocked, but none among the apps I checked did that.

"Cap alpha to max if SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE          As part of go/untrusted-touches for S, we blocked touches from passing     windows of different UIDs regardless of targetSdk. For SAWs, we applied     an opacity rule where apps would be able to let touches pass through     (usually via FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE) as long as their cumulative opacity in     the touch area wasn't greater than 0.8.          This resulted in some overlay apps being broken, which we expected and     saw to some extent in df/dp/beta, but we had reached out and some apps     fixed the issue. But the issue seems to be more widespread and OEM has     escalated the issue, reporting it to be affecting them more severely     (see bug).          So, we automatically make SAW + FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE windows have 20%     transparency to try to honor FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE and let touches pass     through. Note that if the app has overlapping windows the cumulative     opacity would be taken into consideration and the touch could still be     blocked, but none among the apps I checked did that.

"audioservice: improve SCO audio control logic          In AudioDeviceBroker, make sure all methods controlling the SCO audio     state are called from the handler thread to propely serialize them.     This is important in a scenario were multiple clients are     interacting and try to control SCO audio activity independently.     For instance when a VoIP call over SCO is interrupted by an incoming call     and the call is rejected.          Also make sure we properly restart the SCO audio link if requested     (instead of just reapplying the route according to actual SCO audio state)     when a change in audio mode owner happens or SCO audio is disconnected.
